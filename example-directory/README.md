**README.md**

This folder contains various code examples for graph and sorting algorithms.

**Graph Algorithms:**

* **Dijkstra.java:** Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted directed graph. It prints the resulting distances to each node from a specified source node.

**Sorting Algorithms:**

* **algorithms.py (Python):**
    * Implementations of bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
    * Functions to sort arrays using these algorithms.

* **algorithms_go.go (Go):**
    * Demonstrates bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
    * Applies the algorithms to an integer array, printing the before and after states.

**Usage:**

* **Dijkstra.java:**
    * Compile with `javac Dijkstra.java`
    * Run with `java Dijkstra`
* **algorithms.py:**
    * Import the `algorithms` module and use the sorting functions as needed.
* **algorithms_go.go:**
    * Run with `go run algorithms_go.go`

**Dependencies:**

* JDK for Dijkstra.java compilation

**Notes:**

* The algorithms are provided for educational purposes and may not be optimized for performance.
* The code is not extensively tested and may contain bugs.
